```typescript
const NUM_CLUSTERS = 24; // Change this number
```

Then re-run the clustering script.

### Change Map Center

Edit `/components/MapContainer.tsx`:

```typescript
const center = {
  lat: 0.1473, // Your latitude
  lng: 35.7962, // Your longitude
}
```

### Change Colors

Edit `/lib/utils.ts` in the `getClusterColor` function:

```typescript
const colors = [
  '#FF6B6B', // Add or modify colors
  // ...
];
```

## 🔐 API Key Security

### For Development
- API key is in `.env.local`
- This file is gitignored (not committed)

### For Production
- Set environment variable in Vercel/Netlify dashboard
- Never commit API keys to Git
- Restrict API key in Google Cloud Console:
  1. Go to: console.cloud.google.com
  2. APIs & Services → Credentials
  3. Edit your API key
  4. Add HTTP referrer restrictions (your domain)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Map not loading
**Problem:** Blank screen or map not showing  
**Solution:** Check that `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` is set in `.env.local`

### "Failed to load data" error
**Problem:** Cannot load school data  
**Solution:** Ensure data files exist in `/public/data/` folder

### Slow performance
**Problem:** Map is laggy  
**Solution:** Filter to fewer counties or use "Centers Only" view

### Build errors
**Problem:** TypeScript or build errors  
**Solution:** Delete `.next` folder and `node_modules`, then:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
